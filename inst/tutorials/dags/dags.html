<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to HDAT9700 Statistical Modelling II - Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs)!</p>
<p><img src="https://youtu.be/lhkmc-dXC7M" /></p>
<p>In this chapter you will learn how to represent assumptions about
casual mechanisms using a special type of graph: a Directed Acyclic
Graph, or DAG. DAGs are useful because they allow us to formalise our
assumptions and can help inform variable selection for causal
models.</p>
<p>In this chapter you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Represent common causal structures using a DAG</li>
<li>Identify adjustment variables using a DAG</li>

<h3>Prereadings</h3>
<p>The pre-reading for this chapter is a <em>tweetorial</em> by
epidemiologist <a href="https://twitter.com/EpiEllie">Ellie Murray</a>
from Boston University School of Public Health.</p>
<p>The tweetorial focuses on <strong>“the importance of being clear
about your question &amp; using that to drive your methods”</strong>.
Find it <a
href="https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1214641734900224003">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ellie’s tweetorial was prompted by a disparaging tweet about <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2017146.pdf">this</a> study,
which explores the relationship between frozen shoulder and the risk of
cancer. The disparaging tweet criticised the study for failing to adjust
for confounding. In her tweetorial, Ellie explains that this was a
descriptive study, not one addressing a causal question and that in fact
adjusting for confounding may well have led to the wrong answer to the
question at hand.</p>
<p>This pre-reading should help you understand that we always need to be
clear about the purpose of our models, as our purpose dictates how we
specify the model and what variables we should control for.</p>

<h2>Three tasks of data science</h2>
<p>The statistical analyses you will perform as Health Data Scientists
can be categorised according to three broad tasks of data science.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Description</li>
<li>Prediction</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Description</strong> involves using statistical models to
summarise the relationship between variables. There is no reliance on
any underlying causal theory.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong> involves using statistical models to
predict new or future outcomes (Y) given a set of input values or
variables (X).</p>
<p><strong>Causal inference</strong> involves estimating the causal
effect of an exposure, treatment or intervention. Answering causal
questions boils down to comparing outcomes under two or more scenarios,
for example, “Would this patient have better chances of survival given
treatment A or Treatment B”?</p>
<p>The table below (from <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09332480.2019.1579578">Hernán et al
2019</a>) provides examples of the types of questions, data and analysis
methods associated with the tasks of description, prediction and causal
inference.</p>

class="section level3 aside">
<h3>“Explanation” or “Causal Inference”?</h3>
<p>Causal inference tasks are often referred to as “Explanation” (see
the video <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWH_HNfQVRI&amp;t=1s">To Explain
or to Predict?</a> for example). However, Hernán et al (2019) emphasise
that <strong>quantifying causal effects doesn’t necessarily equate to
explaining causal mechanisms</strong>. This is a fair point: knowing
that smoking causes cancer is different to knowing which chemicals are
carcinogenic, for example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-variable-selection" class="section level2">
<h2>Variable selection</h2>
<p>As you learned from this chapter’s pre-reading, how we go about
choosing the variables to include in the model depend crucially on what
we are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>For <strong>predictive</strong> models, the goal is to build a model
that accurately predicts the outcome of interest with high sensitivity
and specificity, and performs well on new data. In terms of variable
selection, the primary consideration is choosing variables that help to
achieve this goal (although you would also consider practical things
like what variables will be available at the time of prediction).
Variable selection could be based on univariate analysis, selecting
variables that show a strong association with the outcome, or a
selection algorithm like forward, backward or stepwise selection. Many
machine learning algorithms will will automatically select (or
appropriately weight) the most predictive variables from the available
set of covariates. The covariates in a predictive model all play the
same role so we can refer to them collectively as
<strong>predictors</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>causal</strong> models, the goal is to estimate the
effect of a given intervention or treatment on a predefined outcome of
interest. Really, the only parameter of interest from our causal model
is the estimate for that intervention or treatment. In this context,
other variables (that may or may not be available in your dataset) have
different roles and different names which you might already have come
across: <strong>confounders</strong>, <strong>mediators</strong> and
<strong>colliders</strong>. Importantly, this means that <strong>just
because a variable is correlated with the outcome of interest, that
doesn’t necessarily mean it is a good candidate to include in the
model</strong>. In order to understand what variables to include in a
causal model, we need to recognise these different types of variables,
and understand the role they play in the causal relationship of
interest.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between confounders, mediators, colliders and other
types of variables relies on expert knowledge about the subject matter
in question. There is no algorithm or automated selection procedure that
can replace this knowledge. Directed Acyclic Graphs, the main topic of
this chapter, are an important tool that help us to formalise and
graphically represent expert knowledge, and in doing so can help us to
select the variables that should be included in a causal model.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-dags" class="section level2">
<h2>DAGs</h2>
<div id="section-directed-acyclic-graphs-dags" class="section level3">
<h3>Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)</h3>
<p>DAGs are graphical tools used to represent the assumptions about
causal relationships for a given problem. Representing these assumptions
using a graph is an important approach because it allows you to</p>
<ul>
<li>Express expert knowledge explicitly</li>
<li>Facilitate discussions about variable selection with co-authors</li>
<li>Communicate your assumptions to readers</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-a-dag" class="section level3">
<h3>What is a DAG</h3>
<p>DAGs are diagrams comprising nodes (circles or squares) connected by
edges (arrows). These diagrams represent assumptions about the causal
relationships of interest. The nodes in a DAG represent observed or
unobserved variables or constructs while the arrows indicate the
direction of the causal relationship between variables.</p>
<p>In this simple DAG, the arrow points from X to Y, representing the
asumption that <strong>X</strong> causes <strong>Y</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The absense of an arrow between two variables represents the
assumption that neither neither variable is causing or caused by the
other. In the next DAG, <strong>Z</strong> causes <strong>X</strong> and
<strong>Z</strong> causes <strong>Y</strong>, but <strong>X</strong> and
<strong>Y</strong> are <em>causally</em> unrelated (there is no arrow
pointing from <strong>X</strong> to <strong>Y</strong> or from
<strong>Y</strong> to X).</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>As we will discuss at length, the absence of an arrow between two
nodes on a DAG, doesn’t mean that the variables are uncorrelated in an
observational dataset. What if our DAG above represented
<strong>sunshine</strong>, <strong>icecream sales</strong> and
<strong>sunburn</strong>?</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>We know that icecream sales definitely don’t cause sunburn, but you
wouldn’t be surprised to find an association between ice-cream sales and
incidence of sunburn (a case of correlation not implying causation!).
This is a classic example of <strong>confounding bias</strong>. The
relationship between ice-cream sales and sunburn is
<strong>confounded</strong> by sunshine, inducing an association between
the two variables, even though there is no causal relationship.</p>
<p>By using expert knowledge to express our qualitative understanding of
causal relationships of interest, DAGs help us to distinguish between
association and causation.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-properties-of-dags" class="section level3">
<h3>Properties of DAGS</h3>
<p>There are some formal requirements for a causal DAG. As indicated by
the name, DAGs should be <strong>directed</strong> and
<strong>acyclic</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Directed</strong> The relationship between nodes are
<em>directional</em>. The arrows indicate the direction of
causality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acyclic</strong> DAGs must not have <em>cycles</em>
between the nodes, i.e. a variable should not “cause” itself, either
directly or through other variables. You can spot a cyclic relationship
if it is possible to start at one node and follow the directional arrows
to arrive back at the same node.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of a <strong>cyclic</strong> graph. The logic
here is tempting: good health will improve educational outcomes, high
levels of education will increase income and higher income can improve
health. However this results in a cyclic graph: it is posible to start
at any node and follow the directional arrows to return to that node,
for example the path <strong>health</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <strong>education</strong>
<span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <strong>income</strong>
<span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>
<strong>health</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>This would suggest that health status causes health status. Because
this graph is cyclic and not acyclic, it does not meet the formal
requirements for a DAG. Often, we can untangle cyclic relationships by
considering the timing of causes and effects. For example, the
relationship between health, education and income could be re-expressed
more meaningfully by considering health status at different points in
time, as represented below.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>This is a now valid DAG because it is <strong>directional</strong>
and <strong>acyclic</strong>. Note the DAG above follows the convention
that time moves from left to right.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-causal-markov-assumption" class="section level3">
<h3>The causal Markov assumption</h3>
<p>A further property of a causal DAG is the <strong>causal Markov
assumption</strong>. Although this sounds a bit scary, it is quite
simple (cf Hernán and Robins 2020 Chapter 6 Technical Point 6.1 for a
formal definition). It means that a common cause of any pair of
variables on a DAG should also be included in the DAG.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say we are interested in the causal relationship
between between aspirin and pulmonary embolism, in a setting where
aspirin is more often prescribed to patients with high blood pressure.
In this case, high blood pressure is a <strong>common cause</strong> of
both aspirin usage and pulmonary embolism: patients with high blood
pressure are more likely to be taking aspirin and high blood pressure
increases the risk of a pulmonary embolism. To satisfy the causal Markov
assumption, blood pressure should be included in the DAG (and controlled
for in any corresponding analysis).</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Now, imagine a different setting where aspirin has been administered
as the intervention in a randomised control trial. In this case,
patients are randomly assigned, so there is no causal relationship
between blood pressure and taking aspirin. Blood pressure still
increases the risk of having a pulmonary embolism, but it is no longer a
<strong>common cause</strong> of taking aspirin and having a pulmonary
embolism so it is not necessary to include on the DAG.</p>

<div id="section-other-terminology" class="section level3">
<h3>Other terminology</h3>
<p>Consider the DAG below which an investigator might use when
postulating the causal relationship between exercise and melanoma. We
will use this DAG to explain some additional useful terminology.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<div id="section-path" class="section level4">
<h4>Path</h4>
<p>A path between two nodes in a DAG is a route that connects the two
nodes, visiting no node more than once. The arrows don’t have to point
in the same direction, but if they do the path is considered a
<em>causal path</em>.</p>
<p>Below are examples of paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>exercise <span class="math inline">\(\leftarrow\)</span> health
consciousness <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> screening
(Not a causal path)</li>
<li>health consciousness <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> screening <span
class="math inline">\(\leftarrow\)</span> melanoma (Not a causal
path)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are examples of <strong>causal</strong> paths</p>
<ul>
<li>exercise <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> sun
exposure <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> melanoma</li>
<li>sunexposure <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span>
melanoma</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-parent" class="section level4">
<h4>Parent</h4>
<p>The parents for a given node in a DAG are the set of variables with
an arrow pointing directly into that node. For example, a parent of
<strong>melanoma</strong> is <strong>sun exposure</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-child" class="section level4">
<h4>Child</h4>
<p>A child of a given node X is any variable with an arrow pointing
directly from X. For example, <strong>exercise</strong> and
<strong>screening</strong> are child nodes of <strong>health
consciousness</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-descendants-and-ancestors" class="section level4">
<h4>Descendants and Ancestors</h4>
<p>The ancestors of a node are any nodes on the causal path leading to
that node. The descendants of a node are any nodes that can be reached
by following causal paths.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>ancestors</strong> of sun exposure are exercise and
health consciousness</li>
<li>The <strong>descendants</strong> of health consciousness are
exercise, sun exposure, melanoma and screening</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-confounder" class="section level4">
<h4>Confounder</h4>
<p>A confounder is a <strong>common cause</strong> of two nodes (usually
the common cause of an exposure and an outcome)</p>
<ul>
<li>Health consciousness is a confounder of exercise and screening</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-mediator" class="section level4">
<h4>Mediator</h4>
<p>A mediator is a node that lies on the causal path between two other
nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sun exposure is a mediator on the path between exercise and
melanoma</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-collider" class="section level4">
<h4>Collider</h4>
<p>A collider is a node with two directional arrows pointing towards
it.</p>

<div id="section-definition" class="section level3">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Confounding arises when there is a variable <strong>Z</strong> that
influences the exposure of interest <strong>X</strong> <em>and</em> the
outcome of interest <strong>Y</strong>. We say that the relationship
between <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> is <em>confounded</em>
and that <strong>Z</strong> is the <em>confounder</em>.</p>
<p>Depending on the discipline, a confounder is also referred to as a
third variable or a lurking variable.</p>

<h2>Mediating variables</h2>

<strong>Y</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-example-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>A researcher might hypothesise that quality of sleep is a mediating
variable between exercise (exposure) and mood (outcome). We might assume
that exercise will improve sleep quality, and a good night’s sleep will
in turn improve mood.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-how-does-this-look-in-a-dag-1" class="section level3">
<h3>How does this look in a DAG?</h3>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Here there is no connecting arrow going from exercise to mood. Our
DAG reflects the assumption that <em>all</em> of the effect of exercise
is mediated through quality of sleep. This would be an indirect effect
of exercise on mood.</p>
<p>However, we might also hypothesis a direct effect, perhaps caused by
the release of endorphins. In that case we would have both an indirect
path Exercise → Sleep quality → Mood and a direct path Exercise →
Mood.</p>

<p>A collider is a common effect of two variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-example-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose a researcher is interested in whether respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) infection during infancy (exposure) causes asthma in early
childhood (outcome). In this case, admissions to the Emergency
Department (ED) during early childhood would be a potential collider,
because both RSV and asthma will increase the probability of ED
admission during early childhood.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-how-does-this-look-in-a-dag-2" class="section level3">
<h3>How does this look in a DAG?</h3>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>As we will see, identifying colliders is important because
controlling for a collider can inadvertently introduce bias. To continue
the above example, even though the number of ED admissions during early
childhood may be associated with the exposure and outcome but
controlling for this variable would actually
<em><strong>bias</strong></em> estimates of the relationship between RSV
infection and asthma.</p>

<div id="section-d-separation" class="section level2">
<h2>D-separation</h2>
<p>Now that you know how to represent and recognise different types of
relationships in a DAG, how can a DAG help us to choose what variables
to include in a causal model? The answer lies in the concept of
<strong>d-separation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Two variables in a DAG are said to be
d-separated if there are no open backdoor paths between them.</p>
<p>This definition introduces two new concepts that we also have to
define: <em>backdoor</em> paths, and what makes an <em>open</em> or
<em>closed</em> path.</p>
<div id="section-backdoor-paths" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Backdoor paths</h4>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A backdoor path between X and Y is a
path between X and Y that contains an arrow pointing towards Y.</p>
<p>For example, the path ice-cream sales ← sunshine → sunburn is a
backdoor path between ice-cream sales and sunburn.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>You will recognise this as an example of confounding. In this case,
the presence of sunshine induces a correlation or <em>dependence</em>
between ice-cream sales and sunburn. The “d” in d-connected stands for
<strong>dependence</strong>!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-b.-frontdoor-paths" class="section level4">
<h4>1b. Frontdoor paths</h4>
<p>While we are at it, lets also define frontdoor paths. These are any
paths that start with an arrow <strong>pointing from the
exposure</strong> and ending at the outcome. The causal effect of
interest <span class="math inline">\(\text{X} \rightarrow
\text{Y}\)</span> is one frontdoor path, but if mediators are present
there will be more than one front door path. In the mediation example
you saw earlier, both pathways are frontdoor paths because they start
with an arrow pointing from the exposure (Exercise) and end up at the
outcome (Mood).</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Both paths are front door paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exercise → Sleep quality → Mood</p></li>
<li><p>Exercise → Mood</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://youtu.be/6X8yc9qY96M" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-open-paths" class="section level4">
<h4>2. Open paths</h4>
<p>A path between two nodes X and Y is open if the path carries
information or dependence between X and Y. We can open or close a path
between two nodes by controlling for intermediate variables. In most
contexts, conditioning will mean stratifying by a variable or adding the
variable to a regression model.</p>
<p>Importantly, however, whether or not controlling for an intermediate
variable Z opens the the pathway or closes the pathway depends on the
role of Z. The table below outlines what happens in three different
scenarios.</p>

</table>
<p>Note that conditioning on a mediator or a confounder will CLOSE the
path between X and Y. In the case of colliders, the path is closed
unless we condition on Z in which case we OPEN the path between X and
Y.</p>

<h2>Worked example</h2>
<p>In this section we will use the principle of d-separation and
backdoor paths to identify a minimal set of adjustment variables that
will allow us to estimate the effect of Exercise on Mood based on the
following DAG.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>This DAG represents several plausible assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise has a direct effect on mood but also an indirect effect via
sleep quality</li>
<li>Exercise also has an effect on blood pressure</li>
<li>Being a club member has an effect on exercise</li>
<li>The season also has an effect on exercise (perhaps people exercise
less during cold weather)</li>
<li>Being a club member has an effect on social interactions</li>
<li>Social interactions have an effect on mood (hopefully a positive
one!)</li>
<li>Season has an effect on mood (sunlight can have a positive effect on
mood)</li>
<li>Mood has an effect on blood pressure (perhaps being calmer and
happier decreases stress-induced high blood pressure)</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-identifying-backdoor-paths" class="section level3">
<h3>Identifying backdoor paths</h3>
<p>In order to estimate the <strong>total</strong> effect of exercise on
mood we need to close all the available backdoor paths. If we are
interested in the <strong>direct</strong> effect of mood on exercise we
additionally need to close any frontdoor paths, other than the main
causal pathway Exercise → Mood. So let’s start by identifying all of the
backdoor and frontdoor paths between Exercise and Mood.</p>
<div id="section-backdoor-paths-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Backdoor paths</h4>
<p>To identify backdoor paths, look for paths between the exposure and
outcome that have one or more arrows pointing toward the exposure. In
total there are three backdoor paths</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise ← Club member → Social interactions → Mood</li>
<li>Exercise ← Season → Mood</li>
<li>Exercise → Blood pressure ← Mood</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-frontdoor-paths" class="section level4">
<h4>Frontdoor paths</h4>
<p>To identify frontdoor paths, look for paths between the exposure and
outcome where all arrows point towards the outcome. There are two
frontdoor paths are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise → Mood</li>
<li>Exercise → Sleep quality → Mood</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-identifying-adjustment-sets" class="section level3">
<h3>Identifying adjustment sets</h3>
<div id="section-total-effect" class="section level4">
<h4>Total effect</h4>
<p>To estimate the total effect of Exercise on Mood we must close all of
the backdoor paths. To close a path it is sufficient to control for any
single variable along that path.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To close the path Exercise ← Club member → Social interactions →
Mood we could control for Club membership OR we could control for number
of social interactions. Note that controlling for either variable is
sufficient to close the path. We could also control for both variables;
this isn’t necessary to close the path, but it won’t do any
harm.</p></li>
<li><p>To close the path Exercise ← Season → Mood we would need to
control for Season.</p></li>
<li><p>The path Exercise → Sleep quality ← Mood is already closed
(because Sleep quality is a collider on this path) so we don’t have to
worry about this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, there are two possible minimal adjustment sets to identify the
total effect of Exercise on Mood:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Club membership and Season</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Number of Social interactions and Season</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-direct-effect" class="section level4">
<h4>Direct effect</h4>
<p>To estimate the direct effect of Exercise on Food we must also
consider alternative frontdoor paths other than the path of
interest.</p>
<p>We identified two front door paths. The first was the path Exercise →
Mood. This is the causal path of interest so we don’t have to do
anything here (obviously we will include our exposure and outcome in the
model).</p>
<p>The second frontdoor path was Exercise → Sleep quality → Mood. This
path implies that part of the effect of exercise is mediated through
sleep quality. In order to estimate the direct effect of exercise we
must close this pathway, i.e. control for sleep quality in our
analysis.</p>
<p>Thus, there are two possible minimal adjustment sets to identify the
<strong>direct</strong> effect of Exercise on Mood:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Club membership, Season and Sleep quality</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Number of Social interactions, Season and Sleep quality</li>

<div id="section-selection-biases" class="section level2">
<h2>Selection Biases</h2>
<p>Many different types of biases arise from mechanisms that result in
some individuals being recorded in our data and available for analysis,
while data other individuals is unavailable. These biases are referred
to as Selection Biases.</p>
<p>In this section we will take a closer look at one type of selection
bias - nonresponse bias - and see how this can be represented as a type
of collider bias.</p>
<div id="section-survey-nonresponse-bias" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey nonresponse bias</h3>
<p>Suppose a researcher was interested in estimating the effect of
wearing a face mask (X) on the risk on contracting COVID-19 (Y) during
the pandemic using data from a random-digit-dialling telephone survey.
Survey respondents were asked whether they had been wearing a face mask
in public during the last month and if they had tested positive for the
coronavirus. Of course, there are numerous factors that we would need to
include in our DAG to address this research question, including the
number and type of contacts, individual characteristics like age, sex
and smoking status, and the quality and correct use of masks. For the
this example, we will zoom in on one aspect: survey participation.</p>
<p>There is a large literature documenting the many ways that survey
respondents (those who agreed to participate in a survey) differ from
survey nonrespondents (those who decline to participate or can’t even be
contacted). Like any survey we can assume this telephone survey suffered
from a degree of nonresponse - not every sampled phone number provided a
response. In this context, we could imagine that survey respondents are
more likely to wear masks, a correlation arising as a result of a latent
variable: compliant personality type. Compliant people may be more
likely to wear masks and more likely to agree to a survey request,
resulting in an association (although not a causal relationship) between
mask wearing and survey participation.</p>
<p>We can also imagine that individuals with a recent coronavirus
diagnosis may be more likely to participated in a telephone COVID-19
survey, perhaps because they have a personal interest in the topic, or
they are easier to contact because they are self-isolating at home.</p>
<p>These assumptions about the key exposure, outcome and participation
status could be represented with the DAG below.</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>When we estimated the effect of mask wearing on COVID-19 using data
from participants only, we are effectively controlling for participation
status. To see this, consider the hypothetical scenario where data is
available for participants and non-participants alike. In this case,
stratifying on participation status and performing the analysis among
survey respondents only is the same as only having data for survey
respondents in the first place.</p>
<p>Looking at the DAG above, it should be clear that survey
participation is a collider on the path Mask → Compliant → Participation
← COVID-19. And what happens when we condition on a collider? As you
have learned in the section on Collider Variables, controlling for
response status will <strong>open</strong> the triplet Compliant →
Participation ← COVID-19. In addition, assuming compliant personality
type is a latent, unobserved variable, we will be unable to control for
this variable. Thus there will be an open backdoor pathway between the
exposure and outcome.</p>
<p>Under this set of assumptions, our exposure and outcome would not be
d-separated and our estimated causal effect of mask-wearing on the risk
of contracting COVID-19 would likely be biased.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-m-bias" class="section level2">
<h2>M-Bias</h2>
<p>M-bias is a common structure of bias that arises when collider bias
is transmitted between ancestors of the exposure and outcome. When
presented as a DAG, this structure results in an M shape as shown:</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>It should be clear by now that adjusting for m would open a backdoor
path between a and y in this DAG, as below:</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>M-bias emphasises a key point of this lecture: just because a
variable is available and correlated with the exposure and outcome,
doesn’t necessarily mean we should adjust for that variable in a causal
model. This is still true <strong>even for variables that are
“pre-treatment” variables</strong>, as is the case in M-bias.</p>
<div id="section-example-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Below is a plausible example of M-bias presented by (Liu et al,
2020)[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kws165"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kws165</a>] where the exposure
us SSRI use (SSRI = selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, a common
antidepressant).</p>
<p><img src="dags_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>If this DAG were a reasonable representation of the data generation
mechanism, coronary artery disease would be associated with SSRI Use and
Lung cancer in an observational dataset. However, adjusting for coronary
artery disease would suggest an apparent effect of SSRI use on Lung
cancer, even if one didn’t exist.</p>

<h3>Building up the elements of a DAG</h3>
<p>For more complex DAGs, or mode control over colour and placement, it
might be necessary to use the bespoke <code>geom_dag_*</code> functions
that come with <code>ggdag</code> to tailor the elements of your desired
DAG. Click through the slides below to see an example of this in
action.</p>
<iframe src="images/fb-ggdag.html" width="100%" height="400px" data-external="1">
</iframe>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, the position of nodes is random. You can specify fixed
node positions using <code>coords =</code>.</li>
<li>The function <code>dagify()</code> is used to define the
relationships between nodes. E.g. <code>y ~ x</code> indicates that an
arrow will point from <strong>x</strong> to <strong>y</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Passing the output of <code>dagify()</code> to
<code>node_parents(x)</code> creates a dataframe distinguishing between
child and parent nodes of <strong>x</strong>.</li>
<li><code>geom_dag_point()</code> and <code>geom_dag_edges()</code> plot
the results.</li>
<li>Applying <code>theme_dag()</code> provides a nice clean plot.</li>

<p>You might notice that this code differs slightly from the code in the
flipbook slides above. The flipbook code uses <em>slow ggplot</em> as
described by the <code>flipbookr</code> package developer Evangeline
Reynolds in her <a
href="https://evangelinereynolds.netlify.app/post/slow-ggplot/">blog</a>.
Slow ggplot is an approach to writing ggplot code that focuses on
incremental changes, for example, instead of specifying
<code>aes(x=xy, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend, color=parent)</code> in a
single line, slow ggplot separates out each aesthetic element to a
separate line, to emphasise how that element affects the graph. The
editable code above dispenses with the slow ggplot syntax, and is more
typical of how you will write R code in the wild.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>DAGs are a useful tool that allow us to formalise our assumptions
about causal mechanisms under study. Dong so has many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express expert knowledge explicitly</li>
<li>Facilitate discussions about variable selection with co-authors</li>
<li>Communicate your assumptions to readers</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-d-separation-1" class="section level3">
<h3>D-separation</h3>
<p>In order to estimated the causal path between an exposure X and an
outcome Y, the nodes X and Y should be <strong>d-separated</strong>.
This means that there should be <strong>no open backdoor paths</strong>
between X and Y.</p>
<ul>
<li>To close a confounding path (<span class="math inline">\(X
\leftarrow C \rightarrow Y\)</span>) or a mediating path (<span
class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y\)</span>) we can
condition on the confounder C or mediator M.</li>
<li>Conversely, conditioning on a collider (<span
class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y\)</span>) will open
the pathway</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-limitations" class="section level3">
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Causal inference is hard. DAGs can help, but they are no silver
bullet. First of all, DAGs that truly represent causal mechanisms of
interest are likely to be much more complicated that the simple
scenarios presented in this chapter. Check out the posited DAG below,
presented in the study <em>Risk factors for unsuccessful dog ownership:
An epidemiologic study in Taiwan</em> by <a
href="doi:10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.06.004">Weng et al 2006</a>.
Woof.</p>
<p><img src="images/dog-ownership-dag.png" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<p>It should be clear that any useful DAG needs to be informed by
knowledge and understanding about the mechanism at hand. Consulting with
experts is essential when developing a DAG…</p>
<p><img src="images/prof-frankie.png" style="width:75.0%" /></p>
<hr />
<p>DAGs are also limited in terms of what they can represent. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>DAGs don’t contain information about the magnitude or direction
of association between nodes. If an arrow points from X to Y we don’t
know if this is a strong negative effect or a weak positive one. In some
contexts, the edges of a DAG are annotated with a number to indicate the
magnitude and direction of the implied effect.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not simple to represent statistical interaction or effect
modification in a DAG.</p></li>
<li><p>A DAG does not show if a cause only applies to some
individuals</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Despite some limitations, DAGs are a powerful tool. Next time you are
faced with a research question ask yourself, is this a casual question?
If the answer is yes, before looking at any data see if you can draw the
main elements of a DAG. To quote Miguel Hernán:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Draw your assumptions before your conclusions</p>
