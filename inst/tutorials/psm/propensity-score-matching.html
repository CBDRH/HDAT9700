<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to HDAT9700 Statistical Modelling II Propensity Score Matching!</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the challenge of drawing <strong>causal inferences from observational data</strong>.</p>
<p>Previously, you learned about randomised control trials (RCTs), and different approaches to randomisation, including simple, block and stratified randomisation. RCTs are the gold standard design for estimating causal effects: because treatment assignment is under the researchers’ control, it is possible to balance the characteristics of treated and untreated individuals, therefore any difference in their outcomes can be ascribed to the effect of the treatment or intervention.</p>
<p>When analysing observational data, treatment assignment is no longer under the researchers control. As a result, treated and untreated individuals may differ in ways related to the outcome, therefore it is not straightforward to ascribe differences in the outcome to the treatment.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will explore <strong>matching</strong> as a general approach used to improve causal inferences from observational data. In broad terms, matching is a preprocessing technique that relies on pruning or duplicating observations so that the treated and untreated groups are similar in terms of their background characteristics.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter you will be able to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand the challenges of drawing causal inferences from observational data</li>
<li>Discuss the assumptions needed to estimate causal effects from observational data</li>
<li>Implement various approaches to matching using the R package <code>MatchIt</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The reference text for this chapter is “Matching as Nonparametric Preprocessing for Reducing Model Dependence in Parametric Causal Inference” by Daniel Ho, Kosuke Imai, Gary King and Elizabeth Stuart, available <a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/matchp.pdf">here</a>. This chapter also draws heavily on the work of Miguel Hernán and colleagues—references are provided at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>So let’s get <em>started</em>!!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-is-causal-inference" class="section level2">
<h2>What is causal inference?</h2>
<p>The models that we fit as data scientists perform different functions and allow us to answer different questions. Statistical modeling tasks have been classified into three categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Description<br />
</li>
<li>Prediction<br />
</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Descriptive</strong> models can answer questions such as <em>what are the characteristics of children who participate in an early childhood program?</em></p>
<p><strong>Predictive</strong> models can answer questions such as <em>what is the probability of on-track development following participation in an early childhood program?</em></p>
<p><strong>Causal models</strong> can answer questions such as <em>does participation in an early childhood program improve children’s development, on average?</em></p>
<p>Causal inference is the science of posing and answering causal questions, “<em>questions which predict certain features of the world if the world had been different</em>” (Hernán et al 2018)</p>
<hr />
<p>There are many frameworks for assessing causality, some of which you covered in HDAT9200 Statistical foundations for health data science. Classical frameworks include the Bradford Hill Criteria and Rothman’s sufficient-component cause model.</p>
<p>In this chapter we approach causal inference from the <strong>counterfactual framework</strong>. This approach lends itself to more formalised discussion and identification of causal effects. The literature on counterfactual theory pays scant lip service to classical epidemiological frameworks such as the Bradford Hill criteria, but nonetheless these are still relevant and useful.</p>
<div class="aside">
<h3 id="section-aside">Aside</h3>
<p>As a reminder, the <strong>Bradford Hill Criteria</strong> are listed below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Strength (effect size)<br />
</li>
<li>Consistency (reproducibility)<br />
</li>
<li>Specificity<br />
</li>
<li>Temporality<br />
</li>
<li>Biological gradient<br />
</li>
<li>Plausibility<br />
</li>
<li>Coherence<br />
</li>
<li>Experiment<br />
</li>
<li>Analogy</li>
</ol>
</div>
<hr />
<div id="section-spurious-correlations" class="section level3">
<h3>Spurious correlations</h3>
<p>We are all familiar with the old adage that <em>correlation does not imply causation</em>. Spurious correlations abound:</p>
<p>Number of films Nicolas Cage appeared in correlates with Number of people who drowned by falling into a swimming-pool <span class="math inline">\(\rho=0.67\)</span></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/spurious1.png" alt="Reproduced with permission from http://tylervigen.com" />
<p class="caption">Reproduced with permission from <a href="http://tylervigen.com" class="uri">http://tylervigen.com</a></p>
</div>
<p><strong>People who drowned after falling out of a fishing boat</strong> correlates with <strong>Marriage rate in Kentucky</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\rho=0.95\)</span></p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Reproduced with permission from <a href="http://tylervigen.com" class="uri">http://tylervigen.com</a></p>
</div>
<p>Of course we know that correlation does not imply causation. Nonetheless:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of confounding, observational estimates and causal estimates are the same<br />
</li>
<li>With observational data, we can still pose and answer causal questions (provided sufficient background information is present)<br />
</li>
<li>Even RCTs can only provided measures of association—we are just more confident in interpreting these as causal because of the experimental design.<br />
</li>
<li>Causal inferences from a rich observational dataset can be more reliable than those from a sub-par RCT (especially if the sample is small and treatment adherence is poor)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="section-counterfactual-outcomes" class="section level2">
<h2>Counterfactual outcomes</h2>
<p>Counterfactual outcomes refer to outcomes under alternative treatments or scenarios. These treatments may not have happened in real life so counterfactual outcomes are usually hypothetical!</p>
<div id="section-an-example" class="section level4">
<h4>An example</h4>
<p>The table below gives an example of the development outcomes (On-track/vulnerable) we might observe for children, some of who attended an early childhood program:</p>

<ul>
<li>For Anne and Katie, we only observe what happened given that they did participate in the program<br />
</li>
<li>For Barry, we only observe what happened given that he did not participate</li>
</ul>
<p>The counterfactual framework is based on the premise of knowing outcomes under both scenarios. This is a conceptual idea only: of course we can not observe the counterfactual, we must imagine we have the power to change history or to reverse time and rerun an experiment.</p>

<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>In order to define a causal effect more rigorously, we need to introduce some notation.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> denote a dichotomous <strong>a</strong>ction, exposure or treatment. Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> take the value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if an individual receives the treatment and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> if they are untreated. Note, we will assume dichotomous treatments thoughout this chapter, but treatments or interventions with multiple arms are of course possible.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(Y_{a=1}\)</span> denote the observed outcome for treatment <span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{a=0}\)</span> denote the observed outcome for treatment <span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span> The outcomes <span class="math inline">\(Y_{a=0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{a=1}\)</span> are referred to as counterfacutal outcomes. They are called <em>counterfactual</em> because one of the outcomes is under a treatment counter to what was actually observed. The term <strong>potential outcomes</strong> is also used, because Anne could potentially receive either treatment.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> denote a vector of observed pretreatment variables</p>
<hr />
<p>To summarise, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> treatment indicator<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y_{a=x}\)</span> outcome under treatment <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span><br />

<h2>Quantities of interest</h2>
<p>Having set up this framework for causal inference, it is possible to focus on different treatment effects by comparing outcomes among different populations. Two treatment effects of particular interest are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>The Average Treatment Effect (ATE)</strong><br />
The ATE estimates the average effect of applying a treatment to the entire population</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Average Treatment effect among the Treated (ATT)</strong><br />
The ATT estimates the average effect of the treatment on <em>those who actually received the treatment</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>These quantities are both valid, but may be more or less of interest depending on context. For example, if a treatment is very expensive and/or invasive, it is likely to be administered to targeted subgroups rather than whole populations, and therefore the ATT is of more interest. The ATE is more applicable in estimating the effect of broad-based interventions that are rolled out to whole populations.</p>

<div id="section-randomisation" class="section level2">
<h2>Randomisation</h2>
<p>Randomised experiments were discussed in Chapter 1. Classical random experiments have three core characteristics:<br />
1. Large <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span><br />
2. Random selection of individuals from a population<br />
3. Random assignment of individuals to a treatment</p>
<p>When these three characteristics are present, any background characteristics should be distributed equally among the untreated (<span class="math inline">\(A=0\)</span>) and treated (<span class="math inline">\(A=1\)</span>) individuals.</p>

<h2>The problem with observational data</h2>
<p>In an observational study, the characteristics of a population are observed but there is no intervention by the researcher. Examples of observational studies include cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies.</p>

<h3 id="section-consider">Consider…</h3>
<p>…a cross-sectional study that gathered information in a community where some children participated in the Helping Hands program. Bivariate analysis showed that children who participated in Helping Hands had significantly lower child development scores at age five. Why would it be problematic to claim that Helping Hands had a causal effect on development from this data source?</p>
<p>Can you give another example of a scenario where causal claims from a cross-sectional dataset may be questionable?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-discussion-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion points</h3>
<p>In the first scenario, assignment to the treatment—participation in Helping Hands—is not under the researchers control. Because the data are observational, we are just observing what has already happened, and children who participated in Helping Hands may have different characteristics compared to those who do not. Crucially, these differing characteristics <em>may also relate to child development</em>. For example, Helping Hands participants might come from economically disadvantaged families, or families where there are drug or alcohol issues. The observed relationship between participation and development may be attributable to these other factors, therefore we can’t claim a causal effect of the program. What we can say is that Helping Hands participation is <strong>associated</strong> with lower development, which can be useful information depending on purpose of the modelling exercise (recall the different modelling aims discussed in Chapter 1, and the distinctions between describing, explaining and predicting).</p>
<p>A famous example where spurious causal claims were inferred from observation data is the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/fulltext">Wakefield et al study</a>, published in the Lancet in 1998. In this study, the authors linked gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression to the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. These results fueled doubts about the safety of the vaccine, triggering a reduction in vaccination levels in several countries. However, the results were based on an uncontrolled analysis of 12 children, all of whom were selected for having both outcomes. The lancet fully retracted the paper in 2010.

<h2>Identifiability assumptions</h2>
<p>In order to make causal claims from observational data we must make some assumptions about the data, particularly with respect to the treatment or ‘action’ <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and any relevant pretreatment variables <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<div id="section-assumptions" class="section level3">

2. Exchangeability<br />
3. Consistency</p>
</div>
<div id="section-positivity" class="section level3">
<h3>Positivity</h3>
<p>The assumption of positivity states that the conditional probability of receiving every possible treatment value must be positive, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\gt0\)</span>.</p>
What this means is that there can not exist a category <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> of a confounder <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> where the probability of receiving the treatment is zero. Mathematically, we can write <span class="math display">\[

</ol>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-exchangeability" class="section level3">
<h3>Exchangeability</h3>
<p>Exchangeability means that the conditional probability of receiving the treatment depends only on the measured covariates. In other words, treatment assignment can’t be related to the outcome <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, either directly, or indirectly through an unobserved confounder.</p>
<p>In a randomised controlled trial, exchangeability is achieved through the random assignment of individuals to treatment groups. Given a sufficiently large trial, this process balances the background characteristics of the treated and untreated groups. Because these characteristics are balanced it doesn’t matter which group actually gets the treatment in an experimental design, i.e. the treatment groups are <em><em>exchangeable</em></em> and hence the term exchangeability.</p>
<p>Mathematically, we can express this relationship as <span class="math display">\[
\tilde{p}(L|A=0)=\tilde{p}(L|A=1)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{p}(.)\)</span> denotes the observed empirical density of the data.</p>
<hr />
<p>Exchangeability is much trickier when dealing with observational data. As discussed previously, when treatments aren’t randomly assigned there may be self-selection or other mechanisms that result in treated and untreated groups being different <em>in ways that relate to the outcome being measured</em>. The second half of this tutorial focusses on pre-processing techniques which can be applied to observational datasets to help avoid this situation and achieve the necessary balance.</p>
<p>We can never know for sure whether the assumption of exchangeability holds—there is no formal test. In practice, we must justify why we believe that departures from the assumption are not too severe, i.e. that we are close enough. For exchangeabilty to hold, all relevant pretreatment variables should be present in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain knowledge<br />
</li>
<li>A theoretical model<br />
</li>
<li>A well-thought out research design</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domain knowledge</strong> is needed to understand what factors are important for the causal question at hand, i.e. those that relate to treatment status and to the outcome of interest.</p>
<p><strong>A theoretical model</strong> is important to clarify what the researcher considers important and to distinguish from other variables that might be associated with the outcome but are not confounders. Graphical methods to describe theoretical models, such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), are popular, but beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
<p><strong>A well-thought out research design</strong> is essential to make sure that the relevant factors, or proxies for them, are available. For example, we can’t control for a potential confounder such as maternal age if it hasn’t been recorded or linked from another source.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-consistency" class="section level3">
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>Consistency assumes that there is a <strong>single well-defined version of the treatment</strong>. It is also referred to as the no-multiple-versions-of-treatment assumption. So for example, we can not estimate the causal effect of participation in the helping hands program if some families only receive parenting classes and some families only receive home visits.</p>
<p>Of course, there is some wiggle-room here: even in a gold-standard intervention study some variation in treatment is unavoidable for practical reasons. In the example of Helping Hands, the same parenting class might be delivered by different instructors in different parts of the state. It is up to the researcher to decide what degree of variability in the treatment is permissable.</p>
<p>Lack of consistency is problematic because it</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it difficult to assess exchangeability and positivity<br />
</li>
<li>Makes it unclear what the practical policy intervention should be</li>
</ul>
<div class="aside">
<h3 id="section-does-obesity-shorten-life">Does obesity shorten life?</h3>
<p>In a short article discussing the importance of consistency, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo200882">Hernán and Taubman (2008)</a> pose the question <em>Does obesity shorten life?</em></p>
<p>Obesity is usually defined as BMI <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span> 30. In answering this question, we can consider the alternative to the “treatment” of obesity to be “not obsese” (BMI <span class="math inline">\(\lt\)</span> 30). However, the author’s argue that obesity is not a well-defined treatment, because there are multiple ways to achieve the alternative to the implicit treatment of obesity, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diet<br />
</li>
<li>Exercise<br />
</li>
<li>Surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, comparing obese and non-obese individuals in an observational study translates to a poorly-defined causal question: the implicit intervention is unclear because it is unknown what “treatment” obese individuals received to become obese.</p>
<p>A helpful thought experiment when estimating causal effects from observational data is to ask what hypothetical RCT you are emulating with your analysis (no matter how unethical or impractical that RCT might be). In the example of obesity and mortality, this would force us to ask <em>what is the treatment?</em> We would then need to consider how would we operationalise the “treatment” of obesity, leading us to more well-defined causal questions, i.e. the effect of diet, the effect of exercise, the effect of surgery etc.</p>

<h2>Matching</h2>
<div id="section-overview-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Matching is a preprocessing step which aims to balance the pre-treatment variables <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> between the treated and untreated groups. This balance is achieved by dropping, duplicating, or weighting observations. The aim is to improve the assumption of exchangeability (which is achieved through randomisation in the case of a randomised control trial). Matching strengthens our ability to say that associations observed in the data are causal.</p>
<p>The key advantage of matching is that <strong>analyses of matched data reduce the dependency on model assumptions</strong>, in particular, parametric assumptions regarding the relationship between control variables and the outcome. This is important because equally valid statistical models can exhibit high degrees of model dependency, i.e. an estimated treatment effect can vary depending on the parametric form of the model chosen by the researcher.</p>
<p>A simple and intuitive form of matching is <strong>1:1 exact matching</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each treated unit is matched to a single control unit within the observational dataset<br />
</li>
<li>The observed confounders are matched exactly<br />
</li>
<li>e.g. each treated child <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with covariates <span class="math inline">\(L_{i}=(l_{1},l_{2},l_{3})\)</span> is matched to an untreated child <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with the same covariate vector <span class="math inline">\(L_{j}=(l_{1},l_{2},l_{3})\)</span>.</li>

</div>
<div id="section-discussion-points-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually there are fewer treated than untreated units, so 1:1 matching may discard a lot of records;<br />
</li>
<li>It may not be possible to get exact matches, especially if there are many covariates and/or limited potential controls</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-matching-workflow" class="section level3">
<h3>Matching workflow</h3>
<p>Analysing observational data using matching is a multi-stage process. The first stage—matching—is a <em>pre-processing</em> step.</p>
<p>The task of matching can be iterative: the analyst can, and should, try different matching approaches in order to optimise the balance in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> variables between the treated and untreated groups.</p>
<p>In the final stage, the analysis of substantive interest is performed using the matched data. This multi-stage, iterative workflow is depicted below.</p>

<h4>Analysing matched data</h4>
<p>The analysis of the matched data could be as simple as comparing the difference in means for the outcome of interest in the treated and untreated groups. However, such a simple analysis will only be appropriate in the case of a 1:1 exact matching.</p>
<p>A better approach is to model the outcome of interest using an appropriate parametric model, including the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> covariates as controls (with appropriate functional forms e.g. quadratic terms etc). Using the confounding <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> variables in both the matching and analysis stages makes the analysis <strong>doubly robust</strong>. This means that inferences will be valid if either (i) the matching stage or (ii) the parametric model is correct.</p>

<h2>Matching methods</h2>
<div id="section-overview-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In many practical situations, exact matching is not possible. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are too many covariates to match on all variables at the same time<br />
</li>
<li>There are too few observations to find an exact match for each treated individual</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative matching methods can be grouped into two classes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Distance-based Matching<br />
</li>
<li>Coarsened Exact Matching</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-distance-based-matching" class="section level3">
<h3>Distance-based Matching</h3>
<p>Distance-based matching relies on some quantitative measure of the similarity/dissimilarity between observed individuals. Two individuals <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are candidates for matching if the distance between them is suitably small, i.e. if <span class="math inline">\(D(i,j) \lt \delta\)</span>. The advantage of distance-based measures is that they reduce a large set of variables into a single univariate metric.</p>
<ul>
<li>The value <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, which determines eligible matches, is chosen by the analyst. This parameter is often referred to as the <em>calipers</em>.<br />
</li>
<li>Matches can be made at different ratios of treated to control, e.g. 1:1, 1:2 etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Two distance metrics commonly used in practice are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Mahalanobis distance<br />
</li>
<li>The propensity score</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-the-mahalanobis-distance" class="section level3">
<h3>The Mahalanobis distance</h3>
<p>The Mahalanobis distance measures the average distance between two multivariate vectors <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
M(X_{i}, X_{j})  = \sqrt{(X_{i}, X_{j})&#39;S^{-1}(X_{i}, X_{j})}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the sample covariance matrix of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Note that this is analogous to the more familiar standardised difference in means <span class="math inline">\(d=\frac{\bar{x_{i}}-\bar{x_{j}}}{\sigma}\)</span> (i.e. difference in means divided by the standard deviation).</p>
<div class="calipers">
<h3 id="section-aside-1">Aside</h3>
<p>The Mahalanobis distance measure was proposed by the Indian scientist and statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis (1893-1972) in the 1920s. The measure was used to compare individuals from Bengal castes based on multivariate anthropometric data, including skull measurements.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why the term <em>calipers</em> is used?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-the-propensity-score" class="section level3">
<h3>The propensity score</h3>
<p>The propensity score refers to the probability of receiving the treatment <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In some settings, such as RCTs, the propensity score might be known and chosen in advance (e.g. people in group A receive the treatment with probability <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>). With observational data, the true propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from the available data. In practice, this is typically done using a logistic regression of the dichotomous treatment indicator <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> on the observed confounders <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. This gives a model of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{log} \left(\frac{1-\pi_{i}}{\pi_{i} }\right) = \beta X_{i}  
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i} = \text{Pr}(A_{i}=1)\)</span>. Given the model parameter estimates <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span>, the estimate of the propensity score <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi_{i}}\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\hat{\pi_{i}} = \left(e^{-\hat{\beta} X_{i}} + 1\right)^{-1}
\]</span></p>
<p>The distance-based on the propensity score for two individuals is then simply <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{i}-\pi_{j}\)</span>. It is also possible to base the differences on the log scale, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\beta X_{i}-\beta X_{j}\)</span></p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="section-utilising-the-propensity-score" class="section level3">
<h3>Utilising the propensity score</h3>
<p>Matching is not the only way to utilise propensity scores to aid causal inference. Other applications include:</p>
<p><strong>Stratification</strong><br />
Under stratification, the full sample is divided into a small number of strata (e.g. 5-10) based on the propensity score. The causal effect is then estimated seperately within each strata.</p>
<p><strong>Weighting</strong><br />
Under weighting, the full sample is reweighted to balance the propensity score between the treated and untreated subgroups.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-criticism-of-propensity-score-matching" class="section level3">
<h3>Criticism of propensity score matching</h3>
<p>Propensity score matching is a very popular approach in practice, but has been subject to criticism, for example King and Nielson (2016) <a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/psnot.pdf">Why Propensity Scores should not be used for matching</a></p>
<p>These criticisms stem from the fact that, once balance is achieved on the <em>global</em> propensity score, the matching process ignores <em>local</em> information on the individual covariates in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Thus, any pruning that takes place is random. Consequently, matching based on the propensity score approximates a completely randomised experiment, whereas other methods approximate a more efficient fully blocked experiment.</p>

<div id="section-discussion-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<div class="family">
<h3 id="section-consider-1">Consider…</h3>
<p>…the following (very) simplified example:</p>
<p>Using data on child and family background, you could use a logistic regression to estimate the probability of being involved in the Helping Hands program, conditional on child and family characteristics.</p>
<p>Based on the estimated model parameters, you find the following probabilities for Bruce (who ultimately did partake in the program) and Sheila (who did not partake in the program). <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\pi}_{Bruce} &amp; = 0.715 &amp; \\
\hat{\pi}_{Sheila} &amp; = 0.725 &amp;
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Based on these estimated propensity scores, matching Bruce with Sheila seems like good candidate match. Sheila, who was untreated, can supply the counterfactual for Bruce, who was treated.</p>
<p>Suppose you dig deeper on the children’s background characteristics (their <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> values). We find the following:</p>
<p><strong>Bruce</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maternal age = 17<br />
</li>
<li>Parental income = medium</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sheila</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maternal age = 32<br />
</li>
<li>Parental income = low</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly the two children have different background characteristics for the covariates <em>Maternal age</em> and <em>Parental income</em>.</p>
<p>Checking the estimated model coefficients, you confirm your suspicions: Bruce has a relatively high propensity score because he was born to a young mum; Sheila has a relatively high propensity score because she is from a low-income family.</p>
<p>Are the two children really a good match?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-coarsened-exact-matching" class="section level3">
<h3>Coarsened Exact Matching</h3>
<p>Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) works differently than matches based on distance metrics. There are three steps:</p>

<h3>Matching using <code>MatchIt</code></h3>
<p>The <code>matchit</code> function contained in the <code>MatchIt</code> package implements a wide variety of matching procedures.</p>
<p>The basic syntax (noting many more options are available) is as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>matchit(formula, data, method = &quot;nearest&quot;, distance = &quot;logit&quot;, ratio=1, discard = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>formula</strong> specifies the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> variables, and takes the usual R formula syntax, e.g. <code>A ~ l1 + l2 + ... + ln</code><br />
<strong>data</strong> refers to the dataset containing the treatment indicator <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the pre-treatment covariates <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span><br />
<strong>method</strong> refers to the matching method. The default is ‘nearest’ i.e. nearest neighbour matching<br />
<strong>distance</strong> refers to the distance metric. The default ‘logit’ bases the distance on the propensity score estimated using logistic regression<br />
<strong>ratio</strong> refers to the number of untreated units matched to each treated unit. The default is 1<br />
<strong>discard</strong> allows the user to prune observations outside the region of common support before matching begins</p>
<hr />
<p>The example below matches treated and untreated units based on the variables <em>black</em> (an indicator for African-American status) and <em>re74</em> (income in 1974). The matching method is 1:1 nearest neghbour matching, based on the propensity score.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>match1 &lt;- matchit(treat ~ black + re74, data=lalonde,

<h2>Assessing balance</h2>
<p>Because exact matching is rarely possible in practice, it is expected that there will be some imbalance in the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> covariates comparing the matched treated and untreated groups. The analyst must assess the degree of balance achieved by different matching approaches, and attempt to optimise the balance.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would like to ensure that the <strong>multivariate</strong> distribution of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the same in the treated and untreated groups. Because <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> typically contains many individual variables, this is often infeasible in practice. A practical alternative is to compare the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> variables at lower dimensions, i.e. univariate or bivariate comparisons between the treated and untreated groups.</p>
<p>Balance is solely a property of the observed data, not some broader population. Therefore, hypothesis testing, or statistical significance tests are neither necessary nor relevant (Ho et al 2007).</p>
<div id="section-common-support" class="section level3">
<h3>Common Support</h3>
<p>Part of achieving balance is ensuring that the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> covariates in the matched treated and untreated groups have an overlapping distribution. This region of the data is referred to as <strong>common support</strong>. Including observations outside the common support is problematic as it requires extrapolation, and therefore model dependence. Common support is achieved by pruning observations where the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> covariates do not overlap. Common support should be assessed for individual variables. In practice, common support is often assessed solely on the propensity score, which contains information on all <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> variables. This may not be a good idea, however, for the reasons discussed previously.</p>
<p>The figure below presents a hypothetical example comparing the distribution of a continuous pretreatment variable for treated and untreated groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>The area of common support is 20-35<br />
</li>
<li>Observations &lt;20 and &gt;35 should be pruned<br />
</li>
<li>The matching process should balance the distribution within the area of common support, i.e. by weighting up lower values (20-25) and weighting down heigher values (30-35) in the treated group.</li>

<h3>Assessing balance</h3>
<p>The purpose of matching data prior to analysis is to balance the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> covariates between treated and control groups. Greater balance makes the assumption of exchangeability more plausible, which strengthens any causal inferences made from observational data. An important part of the process is therefore assessing how well the matching approach has done at balancing the covariates. <code>MatchIt</code> includes several diagnostics to help assess balance, including numerical summaries and visualisations.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the raw data, treated individuals were younger on average compared to untreated individuals (25.8 years versus 28.0 years)<br />

<p>Note that there are two new variables in the matched dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>distance</strong> The distance metric—in this case the propensity score<br />
</li>
<li><strong>weights</strong> A set of weights which balances the matched treated and control units, where necessary. <code>MatchIt</code> weights the control units to match the treated units, thus estimates applying the weights return the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Unmatched units are given a weight of 0 (and do not appear in the file). All matched treated units are given a weight of 1. Each matched control unit is given a weight proportional to the number of treated units to which it was matched. The control weights add up to give the number of uniquely matched control units.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Once the data have been saved, we can use a simple OLS to gauge the effect of matching on the outcome of interest. Recall, the outcome is the variable <strong>re78</strong>: earnings (in US$) two years after the program.</p>
<p>Complete the code below to save the matched data from the matching approaches 5-7, and to compare the simple OLS regression <strong>re78 ~ treat</strong> in the raw data and in each matched dataset.</p>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the model based on the raw data (<strong>mod0</strong>), the average annual earnings are $6984, and program participation <em>decreases</em> annual earnings by $635 on average.<br />
</li>
<li>In the models based on the matched data, the estimated effect of program participation is positive—a more intuitive result
<ul>
<li>$220 based on the nearest neighbour matching with the propensity score distance</li>
<li>$230 based on optimal matching with the Mahalanobis distance</li>
<li>$415 based on coarsened exact matching</li>
